                Slay the Spire has been an unexpected surprise, one of those
                titles that you lanch for the first time just to try it a bit,
                but then you find yourself 5 hours later still playing it,
                absorbed by its depth. In the following lines, I will try to
                explain what Slay the Spire is, why I enjoyed it so much and
                why, after more than 500 hours of gameplay, it's still able to
                entertain me.
              </p>

              <h2>Deck-Building Roguelite</h2>

              <p>
                Slay the Spire is a card game with Roguelite mechanics. At the
                start of each game, we can choose one of four different
                characters, each with its own starting deck. The game is
                turn-based and every turn, we have to decide which cards to use
                from the ones we draw. We also have a determined quantity of
                Energy, a resource necessary to play the cards in our hand.
              </p>

              <p>
                <span class="image__article--span">
                  <img
                    src="img/card_pick-lazy.jpg"
                    data-src="img/card_pick.JPG"
                    alt="Card reward"
                    class="image__paragraph lazy-img"
                  />
                </span>
                We will start every run with a base starting deck, to which we
                will add new and more powerful cards winning fights. At the and
                of each fight in fact the game gives us one of three cards we
                can choose from as a reward for the victory. We will also have
                the opportunity to increase our deck size buying cards from a
                merchant we will find once in a while. On our way we will obtain
                also the
                <strong>Relics</strong> - powerful items that will buffs
                permanently - and <strong>Potions</strong> - consumable items
                that can perform several actions, like damaging enemies, healing
                our character and more.
              </p>

              <p>
                Our path is procedurally generated, so it will be casual and
                different in every game. On our way to the top of the Spire, we
                will fight normal enemies, mini-boss named
                <strong>Ã‰lites</strong> and at the and of each of the 3 acts a
                powerful <strong>Boss</strong> will wait for us. We will also
                find the <strong>Merchant</strong> - that will have a random
                inventory of cards, relics and potions - and the
                <strong>casual events</strong> that can be favourable or not.
                Finally, we will also find the Campfires where we can choose if
                we want to rest to regain Health Points or to upgrade one of our
                cards.
              </p>

              <h2>Challenge and satisfaction</h2>

              <p>
                Behind these apparently easy mechanics, Slay the Spire hides a
                unique depth and complexity. Being able to finish all 3 acts of
                the game is an exciting challenge but it is not easy to
                complete, not even at the first of 20 difficulties available.
              </p>

              <p>
                The key to getting to the top of the Spire is the ability to
                build a deck where each card and relic is in synergy with the
                others in our possession. This is the aspect that makes Slay the
                Spire a compelling and satisfying game: building a deck that
                allows us to unleash a series of powerful attacks one after the
                other, or to poison the current boss so much, to be able to
                defeat it without even using an attack card, gives the player a
                sense of satisfaction and fulfilment that, personally, I rarely
                found in other productions. We start each game always with the
                same cards, without any progress carried from previous games. So
                we can rely only on our ability to adapt to the situation,
                choosing the best path and the best items possible to match
                those already in its possession.
              </p>

              <p>
                <span class="image__article--span">
                  <img
                    src="img/defeat-lazy.jpg"
                    data-src="img/defeat.JPG"
                    alt="Defeat"
                    class="image__paragraph lazy-img"
                  />
                </span>
                The Roguelite nature of the game and the randomness of the
                events force us to always try new strategies. For example, we
                could have succeeded in beating the game thanks to a
                well-matched pair of cards, but it is not certain that we will
                be successful again using the same two. Also, we can slay the
                spire in a run with an offensive deck, based on cards that
                increase the strength parameter and on attacks that scale with
                it, and winning the next game with a deck based totally on high
                defence.
              </p>

              <p>
                The game is incredibly good in giving us the impression, even in
                the defeat, to have learned something. Each game increase our
                skills, our ability to make the best possible choices in
                building our deck, to choose the right cards to play during a
                fight and to choose the best path to follow to get to the end.
              </p>

              <h2>Achievements</h2>

              <p>
                Finally, a small mention of the Achievements or Trophies. The
                game features 44 Achievements from the base game and 2 from the
                single DLC. There are a few challenging objectives like
                completing the game at Ascension 20, the maximum difficulty, or
                completing the game in less than 20 minutes, finish the game
                with one single relic or with a deck of 5 or fewer cards. All
                these challenges are particularly interesting for gamers that
                already expert of the game and that are looking for a challenge
                within a challenge.

                <p>
                  Slay the Spire is highly recommended for anyone who's looking
                  for a challenging game and want to test himself. The game is
                  incredibly fulfilling and motivate the player making him feel
                  more intelligent and more capable every game. It has
                  practically infinite longevity and it is sold at a budget
                  price.<br />

                  I recommend it with no reservations.
