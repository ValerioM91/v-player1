              <p>
                CrossCode is a game within a game. We are Lea, an avatar of a
                fictional MMORPG named CrossWorlds. In CrossWorlds, players are
                physically in the game through the use of avatars, controlled by
                the player's minds. Our character has lost the use of the word
                and does not remember anything of both real past and the one
                inside the game. A man named Sergey tries to help by informing
                us that it is not our first playthrough and that progresssing
                into the game we will be able to recover the memory.
              </p>
              <p>
                In our adventure, we'll meet new characters who will join our
                party and will compose a truly variegated cast. We will get
                acquainted with characters like Emilie, strong, determined and
                extremely competitive, Toby, quiet and conciliatory, Apollo, a
                theatrical champion of justice, and many more, all always well
                characterized.
              </p>
              <p>
                The story takes several hours to find a good rhythm. The first
                hours, in fact, are just a huge tutorial where I found myself
                overwhelmed with information regarding various aspects of the
                game: from info on the deep combat system, to how to level up
                our character, to notions about the world of CrossWorlds.
                Anyways, after the first few hours, I started to enjoy the
                storyline a lot more and it motivates me to want to get to the
                epilogue and to discover the truth about the protagonist's past.

              />

              <h2>Combat system</h2>

              <p>
                The game is an action-RPG with a top-down view. Our class is the
                Spheromancers one, fighters who alternate melee attacks to
                ranged attacks by throwing energy-balls. We can set the type of
                our attacks: we can leave them neutral or assign them one of
                them four elements (fire, ice, wave and lightning) that we will
                unlock along our way. We will also have the ability to dodge, to
                parry with a shield and several special skills.
              </p>
              <p>
                To progress in the game we will have to master each of these
                skills, to be quick using them and to be fast in the decisions
                to take. It will be essential to find the enemies elemental
                weakness to do more damage, but we will not be able to rely only
                on to elemental attacks. Their use is subject to overload, we
                will therefore have to alternate them with attacks neutral. All
                of this while we will be busy dodging enemy shots and parring
                with the shield.
              </p>

              <img
                src="img/attack-lazy.jpg"
                data-src="img/attack.JPG"
                alt="Melee Attack"
                class="image__article--center lazy-img"
              />

              <p>
                All these mechanics combined create a combat system that is
                always fast and exciting, that finds its apex in the battles
                against the powerful and challenging bosses. The only aspect
                that I found slightly negative is the amount of HP some common
                enemies have and therefore the too long duration of these some
                clashes, especially in the early stages of the adventure.
                Anyways, we will be the ones to decide whether to fight common
                enemies on our path. In fact, we will always find them in a
                quiet state and they will never attack first.
              </p>

              <p>
                In the skill tree, called Circuits, we can increase our
                parameters, get special skills and more through the use of CP
                (Cross Points), obtained by levelling up. The skill tree is
                huge: there is in fact one middle section for our neutral form,
                and a section dedicated to every single element. This gives us
                the chance to change our statistics and our attacks for each
                element. Therefore we can customize our character so that she
                meets our combat style in the best possible way.
              </p>

                class="image__article--center lazy-img"
              />

              <h2>Puzzle exploration</h2>

              <p>
                The game world is full of environmental puzzles to solve. The
                most challenging ones are those we'll find inside the dungeons,
                the areas where we get the elemental powers. They consist of
                blocks to be moved, locked doors to be opened by keys we have to
                find, special skills to use to be able to advance and much more.
                Their difficulty increases with the progress of the adventure
                and their resolution is pretty satisfying.
              </p>

              <p>
                These dungeons are one of the aspects of CrossCode that I loved
                the most. They alternate the puzzle-solving sections to battles
                with waves of common enemies. At the with each one of them, a
                powerful boss wait for us. These bosses are definitely the most
                challenging aspect of the main adventure. They have tons of HP,
                they hit really hard and require us to learn their move-set to
                be able to respond quickly. Even the most experienced players
                will have hard times with them, but they are incredibly
                satisfying beat.
              </p>

                alt="Boss Fight"
                class="image__article--center lazy-img"
              />
              <h2>Secondary missions and game length</h2>

              <p>
                I got to the credits in about 35 hours. However, another 35 or
                more are needed if we wanted to complete all the secondary
                activities found in the game.
              </p>

              <p>
                The game from the first hours overwhelms us with secondary
                missions to be completed. Unfortunately, most are trivial and
                they simply ask us to kill a certain number of enemies, to find
                certain objects or to for some NPCs to talk to. Plus, their
                rewards are almost always negligible, except for some rare
                cases. Fortunately, there is a teleportation system that is
                accessible since the start of the game and that is usable at any
                moment.
              </p>

              <p>
                In the final stages of the game, we also have access to the
                arena. Here we will be able to face a series of super
                challenging fights that will reward us with a special currency.
                We can spend this currency in some of the best equipment
                available in the game.
              </p>

              <img
                src="img/tree-lazy.jpg"

                alt="Tree"
                class="image__article--center lazy-img"
              />

              <h2>Aspect and Visuals</h2>

              <p>
                The game is made in beautiful 16-bit pixel art graphics with
                top-down view, in the Zelda style from the Super Nintendo era.
                The environments are all well crafted, varied and colorful,
                ranging from verdant areas to desert areas, cities and forests.
                An aspect that I particularly appreciated is the constant
                presence of NPCs on ours path. Being the game set in a MMORPG we
                will see fictional players move around the various areas of the
                game, exploring and carrying out activities. Cities are densely
                populated with the avatars of fictional players to talk to; they
                succeed in giving me the impression of being in an actual
                MMORPG.
              </p>

              <p>
                There are not many types of common enemies and I think that the
                game would have benefited from having a handful more. The
                bosses, on the other hand, are really fantastic. Their designs
                are various and different from each other, with some with
                humanoid features, others with the shapes of gigantic machines
                and many more that I don't want to spoil.
              </p>

              />

              <p>
                I have played CrossCode on Ps4 fat and it sadly suffered from
                annoying framerate drops and also stuttering in some areas. An
                update was already released but it has only slightly improved
                the issue.
              </p>

              <p>
                I also run into a couple of serious bugs that made crash the
                game. In particular I couldn't buy and equip a certain weapon
                and I was unable to visit a place at a certain time as the game
                closed suddenly. I reported these issues and I'm sure they will
                be fixed as soon as possible, but at the moment they are
                present. Online I have also found people who have encountered
                similar problems with the Nintendo version Switch.
              </p>

              <div class="comment">
                <h2 class="final">Final Thoughts</h2>

                <p>
                  CrossCode is a good game. Its combat system is frenetic and
                  satisfying. This one, combined with the solution of
                  environmental puzzles, are the core mechanics of the game and
                  they are certainly its most successful aspects. The game has
                  also a fairly compelling story, a beautiful soundtrack and a
                  very pleasant graphic style. Unfortunately, I had some
                  framerate drops, some stuttering and a few incredibly annoying
                  crash problems. However I definitely loved it I can easily
                  recommended it to anyone who is looking for a challenging but
                  pleasant game, set in a colorful, well crafted adventurous
                  world.
