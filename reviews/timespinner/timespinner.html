              <p>
                On the planet of Winderia, a colony of the empire of Lachiem,
                Emperor Nuvius is looking for the Timespinner, an ancient device
                capable of sending its user back in time. The Qaelans, original
                inhabitants of Winderia, are the protectors and keepers of the
                Timespinner. Sending back into the time a clan member each
                generation, they make sure their clan is always aware of any
                imminent dangers.
              </p>
              <p>
                We will take on the role of <strong>Lunais</strong>, a member of
                the Qaelans and chosen time traveler. During her farewell party,
                the empire finds the clan hideout. Lunais is therefore forced to
                flee together with her mother Selen and quickly use the
                Timespinner. Emperor Nuvius, in the attempt to stop them, kills
                Selen while she uses the temporal device.
              </p>
              <p>
                Thus the Timespinner is destroyed, while Lunais find herself
                into an unknown world that will turn out to be Lachiem, the
                capital of the empire and swears revenge against its emperor.
                During her adventure, she will get the ability to travel between
                the present and a thousand years distant past.

              <p>
                I want to start mentioning a couple of aspects of the game that
                I found particularly well made and that I found pretty
                interesting. <br />
                The first one is the themes the game discusses. The game events
                in fact force the characters to ask themself if what they have
                always believed in is right or wrong. For example, some
                characters question their society and the hierarchical order
                that is constituted of, wondering if it is okay to feel superior
                to an individual belonging to a lower class. Others question the
                war they are fighting and the reasons behind it.
              </p>

              <p>
                The second aspect that I want to mention is the collectables.
                They have the function to expand the lore further. Most players
                - me in particular - do not read all the various notes or
                additional info that can be found inside a video-game. But I
                have to say that those I found in Timespinner are particularly
                interesting. They are letters or notes written by some NPCs and
                they are capable, in their brevity, to outline the personalities
                and the feelings of those NPCs and make us understand the
                reasons behind their actions and behind what is happening around
                us.
              </p>

                alt="The Timespinner"

              <h2>Castlevania: Sand of Time</h2>
              <p>
                The gameplay is really similar to Castlevania: to Symphony of
                the Night in several aspects. There are GDR elements like
                levelling up by killing enemies, modify the equipment to
                increase the statistics and the increasing ability of the
                enemies with continuation of the adventure.
              </p>

              <p>
                The attack is no longer carried out with swords or whips as in
                Castlevania, but through the protagonist's
                <strong>Aura powers</strong>. The latter are of different types:
                some of these, like spheres of fire, allow us to carry out
                attacks at a distance, others take the form of weapons such as
                hammers or swords and perform powerful melee attacks. Each of
                these energy spheres, called <strong>Orbs</strong>, has its own
                level, which is separate from the level of the protagonist. They
                also have a type that allows us to do more damage to enemies
                weak to that exact one. We'll find some Orbs on our main path,
                others instead will require some backtracking or are hidden in
                secret rooms behind destructible walls.
              </p>

              <p>
                <span class="image__article--span">
                  <img
                    src="img/skill-lazy.jpg"
                    data-src="img/skill.gif"
                    alt="Magic Attack"
                    class="image__paragraph lazy-img"
                  />
                </span>
                In addition to the basic attack with the Orbs, we have a
                powerful <strong>magical attack</strong> that uses our Magic
                Points. These powers, which are one for each type of Orb, share
                the level with the Orbs. We don't get them at the same time as
                the Orbs but we will have to buy them later.
              </p>

              <p>
                Another aspect inherited by SOTN is the
                <strong>familiars</strong>. These are small in number and have
                their own level, which increases with their use. Unfortunately,
                having all of them a separate level makes the use of any other
                familiar beside the first one counterproductive. In particular,
                the first one we obtain always have the highest LV and so is
                always much stronger than the others. In addition, we can only
                get a couple of these familiars in the last few moments of the
                adventure.
              </p>

              <img
                src="img/timestop-lazy.jpg"
                data-src="img/timestop.gif"
                alt="Time-stop"
                class="image__article--center lazy-img"
              />

              <p>
                As in Sotn, as the adventure continues we will get
                <strong>relics</strong>, objects that will provide us with
                skills useful to reach previously inaccessible areas. In
                particular, we will get the classic double jump, the ability to
                swim underwater, the slide and some others. A mechanic that
                distinguishes the game from Sotn and other Metroidvania is
                stopping time mechanic. Thanks to a piece of the Timespinner we
                will in fact be able to stop the time in order to avoid attacks
                or use the enemies as platforms. The usage of this skill is
                linked to use of the <strong>sands of time</strong>, a resource
                easily obtainable from the lanterns scattered throughout the
                game world.
              </p>

              <p>
                The game can be played at 3 different difficulties and there is
                also a NewGame+ that will make us restart the adventure with all
                the Orbs, all the skills and all the equipment we obtained
                previously. Played on normal difficulty Timespinner is quite an
                easy challenge with some rare difficulty peaks. It is basically
                possible to defeat all the bosses simply spamming magic attacks.
                Maybe a greater consumption of MP with their use would have made
                the boss fights more exciting and the whole game more
                challenging.
              </p>

              <p>
                The are four different endings: two are intermediate endings and
                are "True ending". We can get 3 of them in a single run, while a
                second run is necessary to get the fourth. It takes about 8
                hours to get to the credits completing the game at 100%, while
                playing the game in NG+ mode is significantly quicker.
              </p>

                src="img/boss_fight-lazy.jpg"
                data-src="img/boss_fight.JPG"
                alt="Boss Fight"
                class="image__article--center lazy-img"
              />

              <h2>Aspect and visual</h2>
              <p>
                Artistically Timespinner is well made. There are no scenarios of
                incredible beauty, but all of them are well crafted and pleasant
                to see. There is a good variety in the settings, ranging from
                forests and caves, to castles, and libraries laboratories. The
                design of the enemies is also well done and various, with only a
                few enemies that are copies of others with just a few different
                details. Bosses are a lot different from each other even if some
                are a little more inspired of others in design. Finally the
                soundtrack composed by Jeff Ball is brilliant, with the presence
                of some classical / gothic elements.

                <h2 class="final">Final Thoughts</h2>

                <p>
                  If you loved Castlevania: Symphony of the Night like I did and
                  you consider it one of your favourite games ever, then
                  Timespinner is the perfect game for you. With a nice 32-bit
                  pixel art design, precise and smooth gameplay and a compelling
                  story, the game manages to carve out a small space in the
                  numerous panorama of the Metroidvania. It does not invent, nor
                  innovates anything, rather it inherits several of its aspects
                  from Sotn, but every aspect of it is well made. Funs of the
                  genre will surely be happy to have explored the little
                  universe of Timespinner and lived the story of Lunais.
