              <p>
                Action-Platformers are one of my favourite genres and The
                Messenger is definitely in my personal Top 5 of those released
                in the last few years.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Messenger was developed by the talented Sabotage Studio and
                published by Devolver Digital and is clearly inspired by the
                classic Ninja Gaiden. The strong aspect of the game is its
                gameplay. In this kind of productions, the commands need to be
                fast and precise and The Messenger excels in this aspect. Our
                character always performs his actions with absolute precision,
                the hit-boxes of the enemies are always accurate, and the game
                has the right pace and rhythm.
              </p>

              <img
                src="img/cloudstep-lazy.jpg"
                data-src="img/cloudstep.gif"
                alt="The Cloudstep"
                class="image__article--center lazy-img"
              />
              <p>
                The <strong>Cloudstep</strong> is the heart mechanic of the
                gameplay and consists of a series of multiple jumps that can be
                performed only after hitting objects or enemies in mid-air. This
                mechanic alone makes the exploration interesting and never
                banal, as it forces the player to learn to alternate jumps and
                attacks, with the right precision and the right timing. There
                are also other mechanics such as the use of the rope dart, the
                ability to climb and to glide that progressively increase the
                complexity in both the platforming and fighting aspect of the
                game.
              </p>

              <p>
                <span class="image__article--span">
                  <img
                    src="img/skills-lazy.jpg"
                    data-src="img/skills.JPG"
                    alt="The Skill Tree"
                    class="image__paragraph lazy-img"
                  />
                </span>
                On our path we will earn the
                <strong>Fragments of Time</strong> that can be used to buy
                skills and upgrades, such as additional life energy, a skill to
                deflect the enemy attacks and more. Personally, I would have
                preferred a slightly bigger depth of this aspect since I have
                purchased almost all of the available skills shortly after the
                middle of the game. However, all the upgrades are somehow useful
                and I found myself using pretty much all of them.
              </p>

              <p>
                The difficulty is well balanced with some sporadic peak of
                difficulty, but the game is never too punitive. The veterans of
                the genre will find in The Messenger a pleasant and stimulating
                challenge. Novices instead will find it a bit tougher, but they
                will not find anything insurmountable or that can ruin the
                general experience.

              <h2>Keeper of the Scroll</h2>

              <p>
                The game is set in a world where the human race has been
                annihilated by the army of demons. The few survivors live in a
                village where they train to become ninjas. They wait for the
                fulfilment of a prophecy that sees the return of the army of
                demons and the arrival of a legendary hero called "Western
                Hero". In the day of their arrival our the story begins. The
                Western Hero who has come to help the village against the demons
                gives a Scroll to our protagonist, one of the village ninjas,
                assigning him an important mission: to become the Messenger who
                must deliver the Scroll to the top of the Ice Peak mountain.
              </p>

              <p>
                The adventure of our ninja will lead him to meet the sages on
                the top of the mountain, to travel to a future 500 years away
                and face the King of Demons. The game is divided into two parts.
                In the first one, we will progress linearly in both the story
                and the exploration of the different areas of the game. In the
                second part, The Messenger turns into a Metroidvania: we will
                have access to a central hub from which we can do some
                backtracking. Thus we can complete the quests necessary to get
                to the end of the game and/or get all collectables.
              </p>

              <p>
                Also, in the second part, the world will undergo variations:
                there will be some temporal fractures that will give a further
                twist to the platform phases. These will turn into a kind of
                puzzle where we will use the fractures to travel back and forth
                in time to change the scenario and get to previously unreachable
                areas.
              </p>

                alt="Present and future"
                class="image__article--center lazy-img"
              />

              <h2>Aspect and visual</h2>

              <p>
                I loved the graphics of The Messenger. The present is in 8-bit
                Nintendo style graphics while the future is in 16-bit Super
                Nintendo style. I particularly appreciated the aspect of the
                scenarios that are really well designed and pleasant to see.
                They have also a good variety that goes from a verdant jungle to
                a snowy mountain, or from inside a volcano to a submerged
                temple.
              </p>

              <p>
                The soundtrack, composed by Rainbowdragoneyes, is absolutely
                stellar and is perfectly in line with the other aspects of the
                game. Personally, I appreciated it so much that I included it in
                my playlist and I'm still listening to it today, several months
                after I finished the game. The thing that I liked more about the
                soundtrack is the fact that is created with the present-future
                dualism in mind. In fact, the tracks of the present timeline are
                in 8-bit style, while the future timeline ones are in 16-bit
                style.

                <p>
                  Sabotage Studios have been incredibly good in creating a
                  modern and fresh experience in a beautiful retro style. The
                  precise and challenging gameplay, combined with pleasant
                  graphics and a fantastic soundtrack, make The Messenger a
                  small masterpiece that cannot be missed by anyone who loves
                  this genre.
